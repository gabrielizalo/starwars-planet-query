# Motivation

Just a React exercise:

- Implement an autocomplete box with a list of results.
- Use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to search for planets.
- When the user hits on one result, this selection should be placed at
  the bottom as a list.
- The user has to be able to select as many items as he wants.
- You can not choose a planet if it was previously selected.
- The user can delete the selection by clicking on a button on each
  item of the list.
- Use Context API.
